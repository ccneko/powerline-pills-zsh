# Powerline Pills Theme for ZSH

This is a powerline theme for ZSH, created by me.
It was inspired in other powerline themes, but with a "pill" feel to it.

## Installation

Ruby (tested with 1.9.3), ZSH and Oh-my-zsh are required for this theme.

This requires a powerline patched font to work properly. I recommend using one of the [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
