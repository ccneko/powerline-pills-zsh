# Powerline Pills Theme for ZSH

This is a powerline theme for ZSH, created by me.
It was inspired in other powerline themes, but with a "pill" feel to it.

## Installation

Ruby (tested with 1.9.3), ZSH and Oh-my-zsh are required for this theme.

This requires a powerline patched font to work properly. I recommend using one of the [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

1. Clone this repository:  
  `git clone git@github.com:lucasqueiroz/powerline-pills-zsh.git`
2. Cd into the folder that you cloned
3. Run the following command to install the theme (Warning: it will change your current zsh theme!)  
  `./install.zsh`
4. Reload your terminal (or open a new tab)
